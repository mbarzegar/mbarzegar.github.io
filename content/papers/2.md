##### Summary
 We derive simple formulas for the asymptotically optimal  quality scaling exponent (channel estimation error decay exponent as a function of SNR)  as a function pilot and feedback dimensions and the channel covariance rank. We further compare several ``one-shot" schemes, in which feedback is computed based on instantaneous pilot measurements at the user side and measure their channel estimation error and (empirically computed) spectral efficiency performance to the optimal strategy.
