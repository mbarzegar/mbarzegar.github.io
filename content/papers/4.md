##### Summary

Using commodity WiFi data for applications such
as indoor localization, object identification and tracking and
channel sounding has recently gained considerable attention. We
study the problem of channel impulse response (CIR) estimation
from commodity WiFi channel state information (CSI). The
accuracy of a CIR estimation method in this setup is limited
by both the available channel bandwidth as well as various CSI
distortions induced by the underlying hardware. We propose a
multi-band splicing method that increases channel bandwidth
by combining CSI data across multiple frequency bands. In
order to compensate for the CSI distortions, we develop a perband processing algorithm that is able to estimate the distortion
parameters and remove them to yield the “clean” CSI. This
algorithm incorporates the atomic norm denoising sparse recovery
method to exploit channel sparsity. Splicing clean CSI over M
frequency bands, we use orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) as an
estimation method to recover the sparse CIR with high (M-fold)
resolution. Unlike previous works in the literature, our method
does not appeal to any limiting assumption on the CIR (other
than the widely accepted sparsity assumption) or any ad hoc
processing for distortion removal. We show, empirically, that the
proposed method outperforms the state of the art in terms of
localization accuracy.
