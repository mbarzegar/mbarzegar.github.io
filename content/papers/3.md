##### Summary

 We propose a comprehensive scheme for realizing a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with
dual-polarized antennas in frequency division duplexing (FDD)
mode. Dual-polarized arrays are commonly employed due to
the favorable property that, in principle, they can double the
number of channel spatial degrees of freedom with a less-thanproportional increase in array size. However, processing a dualpolarized massive MIMO channel is demanding due to the high
channel dimension and the lack of Uplink-Downlink (UL-DL)
channel reciprocity in FDD mode. In particular, the difficulty
arises in common channel training and DL precoding in a multiuser setup. To address this, we develop a unified framework
consisting of three steps: (1) covariance estimation to efficiently
estimate the UL covariance from noisy UL pilots; (2) a UL-DL
covariance transformation method that obtains the DL covariance from the estimated UL covariance, eliminating the need
for DL channel covariance training via pilot transmission; (3)
a joint multi-user DL channel training method, which enables
the BS to estimate effective DL channels given any protocolspecific pilot dimension and to use them for interference-free
DL beamforming and data transmission. Through extensive
simulations, we show that our scheme is applicable to a variety
of communication scenarios in terms of the number of antennas,
UL and DL pilot dimensions, and angular scattering properties. Unlike the common trend in the literature, we do not
make strong structural assumptions about the wireless channel
(such as angular sparsity), ensuring a general treatment of the
problem.
