##### Abstract

We propose a method for channel training and
precoding in FDD massive MIMO based on deep neural networks
(DNNs), exploiting Downlink (DL) channel covariance knowledge. The DNN is optimized to maximize the DL multi-user
sum-rate, by producing a pre-beamforming matrix based on user
channel covariances that maps the original channel vectors to
“effective channels”. Measurements of these effective channels are
received at the users via common pilot transmission and sent back
to the base station (BS) through analog feedback without further
processing. The BS estimates the effective channels from received
feedback and constructs a linear precoder by concatenating the
optimized pre-beamforming matrix with a zero-forcing precoder
over the effective channels. We show that the proposed method
yields significantly higher sum-rates than the state-of-the-art
DNN-based channel training and precoding scheme, especially
in scenarios with small pilot and feedback size relative to the
channel coherence block length. Unlike many works in the
literature, our proposition does not involve deployment of a DNN
at the user side, which typically comes at a high computational
cost and parameter-transmission overhead on the system, and is
therefore considerably more practical.
